# Java + AI Mini Projects

This repository contains small beginner-level mini projects that combine Java backend basics with introductory AI concepts. 
The focus is on learning Java and AI together by building simple, practical programs that can be completed quickly.
The projects use only core Java and basic AI ideas such as automation, rule-based logic, and simple modeling, without any frameworks or advanced machine learning.
